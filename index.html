      <img src="assets/images/ProfilePic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Bruce Harms">

      <p>So you want to know about me. Well, I got started programming in high school. I took a computer programming class where
        I learned Basic. After that a save up enough money to buy a computer and played around with programming. So when
        I went to college, I majored in Computer Science. My first programming position was maintaining Fortran applications.
        From there, I learned and worked in Visual Basic 5, ADO and SQL. My next position had me move to VB6 and C#. That
        position started to required too much travel and time away from home, I switched to application support.
      </p>

      <p>But enough about work let me tell you about my hobbies, because life is about what makes you happy. Role playing games
        (RPG), such as Dungeons and Dragons, have been my favorate form of entertainment since I started playing in high
        school.
